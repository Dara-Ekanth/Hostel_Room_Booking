* Coming Soon!!....
* This is a Hostel Room Booking system using Django and Python!-->

# This is a Centralized database to allot hostel rooms to the college students
This a web application where a user can login and create the tasks, this was built with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web application framework

## Description:
The project “Hostel Room Allotment System” is a system based on accessing the internet to
allot the hostel rooms. Based on First Come First Serve, students will have an option to select
the available rooms based on their interest.

## Problem:
In the previous system for booking rooms there were many problems faced by students like
standing in the queues, waiting for longer hours because of manual entry. Therefore, the need
for automation is a necessity. 

## Solution:
The purpose of this project is to implement an online hostel room allotment system for
students replacing the manual method of room allotment.
